# WebApp #

A simple skeleton webapp which does a number of things for you already:

* runs a server (which check for which PORT to listen to)
* allows login with the following social networks:
    * Twitter
    * Facebook
    * Google
    * Instagram
    * GitHub
* opens and uses a BoltDB key/value datastore
* stores all social IDs in a `social` table
* stores all users in a `user` table
